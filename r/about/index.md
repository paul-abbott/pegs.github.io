# About

pegs is a physical space in Brussels which celebrates and supports music and art practices. We do this by providing a space for developing and sharing works and conversation. This will happen through residencies, recordings, performances, screenings, meetings and publications. <!--pegs is a non profit organisation (VZW) established in 2021.!--> 

Rue de la Victoire 39, Brussels 1060, Belgium.
